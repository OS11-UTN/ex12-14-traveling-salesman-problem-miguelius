# TSP

## Install

To install you need python3 and pip. We highly recommend the use of virtualenv.

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## Use

### ex12.py

To use it just call the script like this:

```
python ex12.py
```

By default it simulates a graph of 6 nodes. You can change it using the environment variable NODOS. For instance you want to see what happens with 10 nodes:

```
NODOS=10 python ex12.py
```

There's also an environment variable called DIMENSIONES that allowes you to try with graphs in more than just two dimmensions. There's not much change in behavour. Just for fun.
